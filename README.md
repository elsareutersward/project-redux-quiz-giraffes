# Redux quiz group project

A group project to learn using global state using Redux. The group decided to build a quiz game about giraffes. 

## Problem

The focus of the project was to practice working as a team while creating the quiz. Before starting the project the team sketched out a draft of how the page should look and what to include. The group than split into smaller groups each responsible for a functionality of the page. 

The group set up a developer branch with the content both team needed to use and then added a branch for each group to code in. During the build the groups shifted team mates on a regular to exchange knowledge and solve problems. Upon completion of the branches, the team merged everything and practiced on how to debug JavaScript.
