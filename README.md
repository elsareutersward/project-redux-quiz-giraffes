# Redux quiz group project

A group project to learn using global state with Redux, to build a quiz about giraffes. 

## Problem

The focus of the project was to practice working as a team while creating the quiz. Before starting the project the team sketched out a draft of how the page should look and what to include. The group than split into smaller groups each responsible for a functionality of the page. To complete the project we used selectors to access redux state and dispatch to trigger redux actions. Upon completion of the different functionalities, the team merged everything and practiced on how to debug JavaScript.
